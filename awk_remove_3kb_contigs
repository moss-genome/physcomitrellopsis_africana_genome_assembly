###Remove Contigs <3kb###
##sequences split by line breaks so first remove the line breaks (or the awk command cant count correctly)
awk '/^>/ { print (NR==1 ? "" : RS) $0; next } { printf "%s", $0 } END { printf RS }' filein.fasta > fileout.fasta

##remove scaffolds less than 3kb
#"!/^>/" means if a line starts with > go to the next line
#“getline” reads the next record and assigns the entire record to a variable called “seq”
#"length(seq) >= 3000" If the length of the “seq” record is greater than, or equal to, 3000 then…
#"{ print $0 "\n" seq }" Print all records ($0) of the variable “seq” in the file that matched our conditions, each on a new line (“\n”)
awk '!/^>/ { next } { getline seq } length(seq) >= 3000 { print $0 "\n" seq }' filein.fasta > fileout.fasta
